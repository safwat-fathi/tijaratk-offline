Dashboard Home Page — Quick Glance Structure (Mobile-First)
1. Today Snapshot (Hero Section – top of page)

This must be visible without scrolling.

Content:

Today’s Total (EGP) – big & bold

Orders Today – count

Pending / New Orders – highlighted in red or orange

Delivery Fees Today (if applicable)

UX notes:

Default = Today

Arabic numbers + EGP

One-tap switch: Today / Yesterday

Why: Merchants care about today, not analytics.

2. Action Center (Most Important)

This is the heart of the page.

Show only things that need action:

🟠 New orders not confirmed

🔵 Orders out for delivery

🔴 Orders waiting too long (e.g. 30+ mins)

Each item should have:

Order number / customer name

Total amount

One-tap actions: Confirm / Call / WhatsApp

Rule:
If there’s nothing to act on → don’t show this section

3. Latest Orders (Last 5)

A very short list.

Each row:

Customer name

Status pill (New / Confirmed / Delivered)

Total price

Time (e.g. “10 mins ago”)

CTA at bottom:
👉 View all orders

Why: Merchants like reassurance that “everything is under control”.

4. Quick Actions (Big Buttons)

One row, 2–4 buttons max.

Recommended:

➕ Add Product

🧾 Manual Order

📦 Update Order Status

📤 Share Order Link

Design:

Big touch targets

Icons + text

No secondary actions here

5. Today’s Warnings / Insights (Optional but powerful)

Only show if relevant.

Examples:

⚠️ “3 orders cancelled today”

📉 “Sales lower than yesterday”

🟡 “Product price not updated today”

🔁 “5 customers reordered this week”

Never show more than one insight at a time.

6. End-of-Day Teaser (After 6–7 PM)

This drives habit + monetization later.

Example:

🧮 “You can close today’s cash in one tap”

Button:
Close Day (even if free shows basic summary)

What NOT to Put on Home

❌ Charts
❌ Weekly / monthly analytics
❌ Settings
❌ Product lists
❌ Customer lists

Home = Action + Reassurance, not exploration.
